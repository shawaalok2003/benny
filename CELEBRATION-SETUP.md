# 🎈 Birthday Celebration Setup

## Required Files

To complete the birthday celebration experience, please add the following files:

### 1. Birthday Celebration Image
- **Location**: `public/birthday-celebration.png`
- **Description**: A fun, colorful birthday image (cake, balloons, party scene, etc.)
- **Recommended Size**: 600x600 pixels or similar
- **Format**: PNG (for transparency) or JPG

### 2. Birthday Music Audio
- **Location**: `public/sounds/happy-birthday.mp3`
- **Description**: Happy Birthday song or celebratory music
- **Format**: MP3
- **Note**: The music will play automatically when the celebration appears at score 11 and will loop until the user continues

### 3. Optional: Ball Bounce Sound

## Quick Setup

1. Create the `public/sounds/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Add your audio files to `public/sounds/`
3. Add your celebration image directly to the `public/` folder
4. Restart the development server if needed

## Image Suggestions

You can:
- Create a custom birthday image with Benny's name
- Use AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.)
- Find free birthday celebration images online
- Use Canva or similar tools to design a custom celebration graphic

The game will work without these files, but adding them will create a much more immersive and joyful birthday celebration experience! 🎉
